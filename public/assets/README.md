# Assets

Add your static assets here. They'll be served from `/assets/`.

**Suggested structure:**
- `logos/` – product logos (reference in `db.json` as `"/assets/logos/product-one.png"`)
- `hero/` – hero section backgrounds
- `teams/` – team avatars

Reference in code or `db.json` using paths like `/assets/logos/my-image.png`.
